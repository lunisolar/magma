     * But doing that in every place sometimes, if not always, asks for an better solution. The immediate effect of having less boilerplate code by replacing
     * anonymous classes by lambda expressions is drastically limited when checked expressions comes into the equation.
     * Of course you can always go with only using unchecked exceptions, but in most cases it is not up to you (e.g. Java JRE, or 3rd party libraries have
     * them anyway).
     *
     * ### Solution
     *
     * What this library introduces is actual functional interfaces that do declare and propagate checked exceptions. Each such interface have additional
     * generic parameter that actually allows to define the exception that can be either checked or unchecked one. This generic parameter is consistently named
     * **X** and defined as **X extends Throwable**. So for example for the
     * LFunctionX interface main method is:
     *
     * ```Java
     * boolean doTest(T t) throws X;
     * ```
     *
     * So now you can have something like this:

    /**
     * What happens is very simple. The **LPredicateX.lX** method is actually only forcing compiler to use more specialized functional interface than the
     * JRE one. Each JRE functional interface (from _java.util.function_ package) is extended by appropriate functional interface from this library.
     * The latter provides default implementation for the method of the former and that method handles the checked exception.

     * ### Addition effects
     *
     * By having an set of functions that have various input and output argument and can handle exceptions we can utilise them for quick exception handling.
     * We could use one single MyCustomConsumer that would do similar job, but the difference is in capturing vs non-capturing lambdas. To overcome
     * disadvantages of a capturing lambda (provided that we got the case that it matters) we again would need to define more functional interfaces than just
     * one - or simply have different approach all together. But with interfaces from this library following quick solution are possible for potential
